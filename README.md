# Presidential_Speech_Analysis

-------------------------------Abstract---------------------------------------------------------------------

Speech can deeply resonate with people, particularly in the context of presidential
speeches, as it can significantly influence their public image. This influence lies within
the emotional spectrum, making it a relevant topic for a behavioral study. By examining
the impact of speech on peopleâ€™s thoughts, we can gain insights into how emotions conveyed
through presidential speeches affect public perception. In this research, we expand upon the
traditional survey methods by integrating machine learning. We extract emotions from audio files
and fit them in a large-scale analysis involving 1,947,792 regressions using transition matrices

-------------------------------Instructions---------------------------------------------------------------------

Notebook_Part1: Create a scrape bot to collect and organize Audio files from Miller Files. We then combine these files
           with the Approval Rates data from Roper Center. 

Notebook_Part2: Create a machine learning algorithm to extract emotions from the audio data. 

Notebook_Part3: Create a Regression model to analyze the relationship betweens emotions conveyed in speech
           and approval rates.

You may run these notebooks to verify my results. It can take time and requires a chunk of memory.

If you wish to skim through the results, please read the report. It will guide you with a clear explanation.
